README.txt

This program allows the user to create an empty list and then fill the list with the book and author titles from a csv flat file database. Individual book/author entries can be added independently of the database to the end of the list. The entire list can be printed as output and you can search through the list to match a particular book or author. 

Current functionality/status: Iâ€™ve tested the code to make sure it can handle the 5 requirements laid out in the HW01 assignment. To my knowledge the program is working on all of these accounts. 

Updates: -added statesabb.csv to databases and included it in the driver program. Made text more general. 
	 
	 HW02:
	 -modified all code to comply with style code standards: 
		https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?
	-added output.txt
