Review of repo:

Style Guide Evaluation:

	In the drive program there is a strong and well worded comment block to start of the code. This is very useful for the reader. There is however in my opinion a bit of over commenting through out the rest of the driver program. Some of the inline comment may be useful while writing the program, but could be removed in the final product. 
	The LinkedList2.py is very well done in terms of comments and style. Not much else I can say about it.
	
	Adhered very much to the style guide good work.

Code Evaluation:
	The Driver program is thorough and explicit  well done. There could be an improvement in variable naming, but other than that it is thorough. I do not understand why populating the list is in the driver program since it is something that could be done with all files. I personally think it should be a method of the BookList class, so that it can be used on multiple files more simply and with less code.
	
	In the LinkedList2.py there could be some improvements. The biggest thing I noticed was the conditionals in some of the methods especially in the new_book. Which is an append function. the code is not taking advantage of all the tools that were written into it. Things could be simplified essentially. Instead of creating the node in the conditional you could create it outside the conditional and save yourself some potential bugs. The conditional itself could also be compressed, but that is more often than not the programmers choice. The way it is written is overly complicated and not using the variables in the class to the best of it's advantage. This is my opinion. The current logic works I think it could be made simpler. Over all I think the code is fine though. Variables could use a little work, but that takes time and experience with the jargon.
