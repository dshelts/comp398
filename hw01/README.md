Homework due 8/28/14:

The driver program is MagicMain.py which imports the LinkedList.py file. This LinkedList file has basic functionality to populate from files assuming the delimiter is newline seperate, to append items to the end of the list, to search for items within the list, and to print the list in a plain text format. This is demostrated by the test suite in the 
MagicMain.py file.
